# Data-Knowledge-Tradeoff-CBR
* Study Data-Knowledge Trade-off in Case Base Reasoning System. 
* Study the importance of domain knowledge in reducing the number of cases in the case base.


<!-- A few observations for the term paper example:
In general, most of the predictions are matching with the expected output. In some cases, like days late = 12 and medical certificate = true, though the data does not accept the paper, the CBR system predicts accepted. 

To get the weights for a given domain:
	python learn.py TermPaperExample/ --verbose

The above command reads the attribute.xml and the data.csv files and generates the weights.


Previous work has mostly used fuzzy logic in CBR systems for better retrieval i.e. improving indexing of cases in the case base. Our attempt is to use fuzzy logic as knowledge to reduce cases in the case base. The papers are included in the "Previous Work" folder.

Regarding the discussion on "Is CBR same as KNN?". One of the papers mentioned the following: " The  most  commonly  investigated  retrieval  techniques  include  nearest  neighbor retrieval, inductive approaches, knowledge guided approaches, and validated retrieval". Though I do not understand the methods, KNN is modeling the nearest neighbor retrieval technique, while there are a whole lot of other retrieval techniques.
